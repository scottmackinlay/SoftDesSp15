salmonella.txt

So all the proteins I found were salmonella related strands which is cool because I didnt 
specify that I was inputing salmonella dna to the protein BLAST. This is what we in the 
business call 'verification'. What's more, certain proteins like ref|WP_000097719.1| is
instrumental in the surface presentation of antigens protein which sounds like something
important. Definitely really important. The 100% match numbers are also encouraging in 
terms of verification because the chances of getting such a large protein to be 100% 
accurate on accident is statistically impossible. 

After hours of research I have found that the proteins that I discovered in the given 
string of dna code precisely for proteins that give salmonella its nasty qualities such 
as its propencity to be made out of proteins.
